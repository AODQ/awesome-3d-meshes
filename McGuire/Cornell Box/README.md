Donald Greenberg and students at Cornell University created the original physical "Cornell Box" and matching virtual geometry. It has 
been used for decades as a standard test scene in computer graphics for photorealistic rendering.

Guedis Cardenas, Morgan McGuire, and Michael Mara created these eight OBJ files that represent some of the most commonly used test 
scenes based on that data. These include the [original box](http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/box/data.html) and many variations by 
Henrik Jensen (the icon image is by Jensen) such as a box full of water. Note that the original real box is not a perfect cube, so the 
faces are correspondingly imperfect in this data set.
