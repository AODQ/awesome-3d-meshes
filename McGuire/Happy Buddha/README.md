# Happy Buddha

Brian Curless and Marc Levoy created this model from multiple range scans of a real object using a Cyberware 3030 MS scanner. Morgan 
McGuire converted the PLY from [Georgia Tech](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/large_models/happy.html) to IFS, computed vertex normals, 
and then exported it OBJ format using G3D. The model is hole-free, but contains small bridges due to space carving, so its topological genus is larger than it appears

Please see [the note](http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/#uses) about culturally appropriate uses of this model.
