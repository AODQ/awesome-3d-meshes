# Cube

![image](https://casual-effects.com/g3d/data10/common/model/cube/icon.png)

A cube with texture coordinates and explicit vertex normals that I created by hand. The cube is centered at the origin and has unit 
volume. I included the checkerboard texture and material mapping to make it easy to modify to place other textures on the cube.

Triangles: 12\
Vertices: 24\
