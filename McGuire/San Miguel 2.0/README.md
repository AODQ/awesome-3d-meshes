# San Miguel 2.0

![image](https://casual-effects.com/g3d/data10/research/model/San_Miguel/icon.png)

There are two versions of the model in this zipfile. One is a cleanup of the San Miguel model released with the PBRT book. The other is 
a lower-polygon version more suitable for real-time rendering.

This scene was originally modeled by Guillermo M. Leal Llaguno of Evolucien Visual, based on a hacienda that he visited in San Miguel de
 Allende, Mexico. These 2017 versions were improved by Morgan McGuire, Guedis Cardenas, and Michael Mara at Williams College and 
 Nicholas Hull at NVIDIA with permission from Mr. Llaguno.

They began with Guillermo's original 3DS Max file and flattened the instancing from the original for convenience in research use. 
 They then exported it as an OBJ file, corrected the geometry and materials, converted materials to PNG and integrated the alpha mattes,
  and constructed a low-polygon version.

For example, on the cover of the PBRT2 book, you can see that there are chairs in the fountain and no legs on the tables. 
 They fixed these and many more problems.
