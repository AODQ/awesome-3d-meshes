# Crytek Sponza

![image](https://casual-effects.com/g3d/data10/common/model/crytek_sponza/icon.png)

The Atrium Sponza Palace in Dubrovnik, re-modeled by Frank Meinl at Crytek with inspiration from Marko Dabrovic's original. 
McGuire took the OBJ version exported by Meinl, computed bump maps from the normal maps using [normal2bump.cpp](https://github.com/morgan3d/misc/tree/master/normal2bump) 
(since MTL files expect height bumps, not normals), put the "mask" textures into the alpha channel of the associated diffuse texture, 
cleaned up noise in the masks, corrected the material mapping for the octagonal vases, compressed the textures using PNGcrush, and 
removed the long untextured banner floating in the middle of the atrium that appears in the file but in none of the published images 
of the model. The zipfile includes the banner as a separate object.
