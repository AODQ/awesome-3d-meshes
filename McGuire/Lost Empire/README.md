# Lost Empire

McGuire modeled this underground, Indiana Jones-style city as part of the Vokselia Minecraft world and then exported it to OBJ format 
using Mineways (http://mineways.com). The entire world has a CC BY 3.0 license, which enables any use with only attribution. The model
 is good for global illumination tests: it is mostly white, has topologically complex geometry, is highly and regularly tessellated, 
 and is entirely "inside" because of the surrounding mountaintop. Placing light sources at each of the triangles with a Torch material 
 provides reasonable illumination.
