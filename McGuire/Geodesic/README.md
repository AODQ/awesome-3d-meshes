86 geodesic and geodesic-dual polyhedra composed of regular triangles, hexagons, and pentagons. These are subdivisions of the icosahedron and their duals. The OBJ files contain polyhedral meshes. If you do not convert them to triangles on load, then the original polyhedra are accessible. Computed using [antiprism](http://www.antiprism.com/) and then exported to OBJ format and manually cleaned up.
