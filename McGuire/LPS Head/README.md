Infinite-Realities Director Lee Perry-Smith created a 3D scan of his head. Morgan McGuire and Guedis Cardenas at Williams College 
converted the displacement file from .tif to 16-bit .png and created created a low resolution version of the bump map. They set up the 
.mtl file's texture maps, painted the bump map so that it is seamless at the back of the head, and adjusted the default glossy highlight 
to better simulate a 3D head.
