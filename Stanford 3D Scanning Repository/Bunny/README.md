Inventor and VRML versions of this model are available from Georgia Tech's [large models archive](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/large_models).
A QSplat version of this model is available in the [QSplat models archive](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/qsplat/).
Believe it or not, we also have a [CT scan](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/voldata/voldata.html#bunny) of the bunny. Check it out!
If you want to fly around the bunny, but don't need the model, try [ScanView](http://graphics.stanford.edu/software/scanview/), our client / server rendering system.
We have also captured a [light field](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/LF/lfs.html) of the bunny, using a gantry made from [Lego Mindstorm](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/LF/acq.html).
This dataset was scanned in 1994 using the zippering technique described in [Turk94].
Here is longer, [illustrated history of the Stanford bunny](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/bunny/bunny.html), from [Greg Turk's](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/) web pages at Georgia Tech.

Note about the bunny photograph: The bunny was bought and scanned in 1993-94. The color photograph (above) was taken on April 1, 2003. The bits of gray plaster on the sides of the bunny's feet somehow appeared since the bunny was scanned; they are not present in the 3D model. The chip on his left ear, however, is present in the model as well, although degraded in resolution.
