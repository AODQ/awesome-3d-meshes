Source: Stanford University Computer Graphics Laboratory
Scanner: Cyberware 3030 MS + spacetime analysis
Number of scans: ~60
Total size of scans: 4,586,124 points (about 9,200,000 triangles)
Reconstruction: vrip (conservatively decimated)
Size of reconstruction: 543,652 vertices, 1,087,716 triangles
Comments: hole-free, but contains small bridges due to space carving, so its topological genus is larger than it appears
