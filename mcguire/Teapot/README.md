Martin Newell modeled a teapot using bicubic Bezier patches in 1975 as part of an entire tea set. It first appeared in his Ph.D.
 dissertation. Jim Blinn scaled the teapot horizontally by 1.3x to cancel the effect of the rectangular pixels on their display. 
 The original had no bottom; most variations add one.

Kenzie Lamar at Vicarious Visions created this version from the default teapot model in 3D Studio Max. He resized the top so that it 
fits snugly, created a shell and welded the spout and handle so that the teapot is a manifold without boundary, and created a unique 
and consistent-resolution texture parameterization for the entire model.
