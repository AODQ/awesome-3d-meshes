This is the standard material test object provided with the Mitsuba renderer. With Wenzel Jakob's permission, they converted it to 
a single OBJ file and separated the backdrop. This data was provided by Wenzel Jakob for the purpose of direct comparisons between 
the Mitsuba renderer and others. Please don't use this for other purposes, such as a standard test object in your own renderer.
