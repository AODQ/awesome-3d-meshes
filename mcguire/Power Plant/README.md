The Power Plant Model is a complete model of an actual coal fired power plant. It has been released for non-commercial use only. 
UNC distributes the model as 1,185 PLY files, presumably because when it was released over a decade ago systems couldn't manage 
millions of polygons as well as they do today. Morgan McGuire and Guedis Cardenas at Williams College merged them into a single 
OBJ file and created an appropriate MTL file.
