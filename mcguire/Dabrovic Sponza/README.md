# Dabrovic Sponza

![image](https://casual-effects.com/g3d/data10/common/model/crytek_sponza/icon.png)

The Atrium Sponza Palace in Dubrovnik. Originally created for a rendering contest and since adopted by the global illumination 
community as a test model. The original has some material problems and its download site no longer available. Kenzie Lamar at 
Vicarious Visions converted the 3DS file to OBJ and assigned texture coordinates to the ceilings. Morgan McGuire hand-painted bump 
maps for most surfaces. Dabrovic never licensed the model himself, but his terms appear to be consistent with CC BY-NC.
