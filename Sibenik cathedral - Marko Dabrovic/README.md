#[Sibenik cathedral](http://hdri.cgtechniques.com/~sibenik2/download/)

The Sibenik cathedral is a project by Marko Dabrovic form www.RNA.HR .
It's very rich modeled but isn't completly finished yet... there are some holes in the mesh which only hurts if you look at them.

Marko have modeled it for Lightwave: [Have a look at his result](http://www.rna.hr/00/SK-chu-HI1.htm)

Be fair and submit an image if you have render one for your portfolio and please place a link to the competitionpage from your gallery if you place the rendered image there... i just found some brazil renderings on the web, which would be worth to submit here.
